# CRUD Application

## Overview
This CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application is built with Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend. It provides a simple interface for managing a list of items, allowing users to perform all standard CRUD operations.

## Dataset
The application uses a database to store and manage item data. The database is a MongoDB Atlas database solution integrated with Node.js. The data schema supports basic operations for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting records.

## Results
The application enables users to:
- **Create**: Add new items to the list.
- **Read**: View a list of existing items with detailed information.
- **Update**: Modify details of existing items.
- **Delete**: Remove items from the list.

The React frontend provides a responsive and interactive user interface, while the Node.js backend handles data processing and API requests.
